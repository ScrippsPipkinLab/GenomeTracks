- **CD8+ T cells** play a key role in anti-viral and anti-tumor immune responses. Upon stimulation, antigen inexperienced na√Øve CD8+ T cells undergo rapid expansion and extensive **chromatin landscape remodeling** & transcriptional profile reprogramming, leading to formation of different phenotypes. <br>
- This is a repository of **ATAC-seq** genome tracks of **murine CD8 T cells**, together with **ChIP-seq** tracks of important transcription factors in CD8 T cells. It can be used as a reference for **CD8 T cell chromatin landscape** at different stages of development / phenotypes. <br>
