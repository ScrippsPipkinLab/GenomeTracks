- This is a repository of ATAC-seq genome tracks of murine CD8 T cells, together with ChIP-seq tracks of important transcription factors in CD8 T cells
= Considering citing [Immunity 2018](https://www.cell.com/immunity/comments/S1074-7613(18)30126-2). 

### ATAC-seq of murine CD8 T cells
- In vitro TCR stimulation time points: 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 hours. WT and Runx3KO P14 cells. Link to article GSE111149
- In vitro cultured CD8 T cells at high(100U) / low(10U) IL-2 levels, with different combinations of PMA/Iono/CsA stimulation Link to article GSE88987
- In vivo sorted CD8 T cells phenotypes: Naive, MPEC, SLEC, Memory,Exhausted Link to article GSE88987
